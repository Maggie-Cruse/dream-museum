<strong>Dream Museum</strong>

Margaret Cruse is a digital technician working with code and new media to develop interactive experiences, looking at themes of embodiment, technology, and simulacra. 

"Dream Museum" curates dreams into a walking simulator, examining the ideas of intimacy and philosophies tied to dreaming. The act of sharing dreams can be incredibly intimate. By soliciting dreams from strangers, I am breaching that intimacy in a public way. 

Using a google form, I solicited dreams from various places: instagram, college common spaces, discord, dating apps. I then pulled imagery from the accounts I was given and interpreted them into vignettes using free assets online, which I placed into a Unity project so that one could explore the space. The images are held mostly in a gummy pink terrain to create a disorienting atmosphere that connotes dreaming but lets each piece speak for itself. The player collects floating cubes, or "mementos," at each scene that fill out a catalog containing quotes from the corresponding dreams.
