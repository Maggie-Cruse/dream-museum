Dream Museum

Margaret Cruse is a digital technician working with code and new media to develop interactive experiences, looking at themes of embodiment, technology, and simulacra. 

"Dream Museum" curates dreams into a walking simulator, examining the ideas of intimacy and philosophies tied to dreaming. The act of sharing dreams can be incredibly intimate. By soliciting dreams from strangers, I am breaching that intimacy in a public way. With that, there are many ideas on dream analysis and meaning that I could incorporate in my work.
